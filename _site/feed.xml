<p>I’ve been mostly a .net developer for the past 15 years, and have worked on everything from windows CE, to IOT, to large scale logistics systems.

<p>I want to share thoughts on all sorts of neat stuff. Rom hacking, 3d game development, procedural content generation, hardware, 3d printing, code reviewing, ways of working.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="greetings." /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve decided to take some time and jot down some things I have learned.
