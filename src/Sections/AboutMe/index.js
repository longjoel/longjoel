<MD text={`Hello! My name is Joel Longanecker. Thank you for visiting my Github page. 
I made this page to serve several different purposes.

* This is my living resume! It's way easier to show people you are a web developer than simply telling them.
* It's a great way to stay on top of the latest and greatest in web development.
* It's hard to have a portfolio page when all your projects are internal line of business apps.
* This will also sort of serve as my bespoke little mini blog.

I have a number of cool GitHub projects too. Check them out!`} />
